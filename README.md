   ```
    cd [PATH_TO_LOCAL_DIRECTORY]\SpacemouseTest
    ```
4. Run the setup script. This will create a Python virtual environment named `manual_alignment_venv` with all the necessary python modules already installed inside.  
    ```
    ./setup.ps1
    ```

## Run Instructions

Let's run a basic manual alignment test using the 3Dconnexion Spacemouse Compact to see how intuitive it is!

1. Open a Powershell terminal on your Windows computer and move into the directory you installed this github repository.

2. Activate your Python virtual environment
    ```
    .\manual_alignment_venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```
3. Run the main.py script.
    ```
    python .\src\main.py
